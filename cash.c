// Problem set from week 1 of Harvard's CS50 class
// Uses the greedy algorithm
// We want to minimize the number of coins that are dispensed when making a change.
// Think of a “greedy” cashier as one who wants to take the biggest bite out of this problem as possible with each coin they take out of the drawer. 
// For instance, if some customer is owed 31¢, the biggest first (i.e., best immediate, or local) bite that can be taken is 25¢. Remainder: 31-25 = 6.
// The greedy cashier would move on to a bite of size 5¢, leaving him or her with a 1¢ problem. 
// At that point, greed calls for 1¢ bite and the problem is solved.
